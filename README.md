# Rig Reavers

A browser-based prototype for a wasteland PBBG concept. This first cut is a small front-end sandbox for the scavenging loop, resource management, and an early war rig unlock.

## Run locally
Open `web/index.html` in a browser.

## Next steps
- Add a backend for persistence.
- Introduce crafting recipes and modular rig parts.
- Connect scavenging outcomes to a timed mission system.
