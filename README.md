# Rig Reavers

A browser-based prototype for a wasteland PBBG concept. This front-end sandbox now includes long-term progression loops: scavenging, timed crafting, morale and injury recovery, crew recruitment, reputation gating, contracts, perk unlocks, war rig assembly, and a multi-stage outpost that adds passive income.

## Run locally

- Expand timed queues for missions, repairs, and crafting.
