# Wasteland PBBG Concept (Original IP)

## High-level pitch
A persistent browser-based wasteland survival game where players start as **war band rookies** and grow into **convoy captains**. Players scavenge, craft, and manage a mobile base; eventually they build a **war rig** that can auto-scavenge via timed missions.

## Core loop
1. **Scavenge**: spend action points (AP) to explore zones for scrap, fuel, water, and components.
2. **Craft/Upgrade**: convert loot into gear, armor, gadgets, and vehicle modules.
3. **Risk/Reward**: decide between safe zones (low yield) and hazardous zones (high yield + injuries).
4. **Progression**: unlock new tech tiers, crew slots, and the war rig.
5. **Automation**: send the war rig on timed missions to gather resources while you’re offline.

## Player fantasy & progression
- **Stage 1: Rook** – Basic scavenger with a pack and a sidearm.
- **Stage 2: Runner** – Improves gear, joins a micro-clan, starts escorting caravans.
- **Stage 3: Captain** – Builds a modular war rig, unlocks convoy management.
- **Stage 4: Warlord** – Runs a mobile stronghold, auto-scavenges, and raids rival factions.

## Systems overview
### Resources
- **Scrap** (common crafting currency)
- **Fuel** (vehicle operations)
- **Water** (survival + crafting)
- **Tech parts** (rare components for advanced modules)
- **Salvage artifacts** (lore + special upgrades)

### Stats
- **Stamina/AP**: spent to scavenge or fight; regenerates over time.
- **Grit**: reduces injury chance.
- **Scavenge**: improves loot quality.
- **Mechanics**: improves crafting and repairs.
- **Tactics**: improves combat efficiency.

### Gear & crafting
- **Weapons**: makeshift (pipe), industrial (rebar), advanced (coil)
- **Armor**: scavenged plates → composite → reinforced
- **Tools**: pry bars, cutters, drones
- **Consumables**: med packs, ration kits, coolant

### Zones
- **Rust Flats** (starter)
- **Ash Dunes** (mid-tier)
- **Glass Wastes** (high-tier)
- **Dead Grid** (endgame)

### Combat (lightweight)
- **Asynchronous**: text outcomes, rolling a few stats + RNG.
- **Ambush events**: chance to fight raiders or hazards.

## War rig system
### Unlock
- Requires **crew size**, **mechanics skill**, and **core blueprint**.

### Modules
- **Engine** (speed, fuel efficiency)
- **Cargo** (capacity, scavenging yield)
- **Armor** (raid defense)
- **Scanner** (finds rare loot)
- **Drone bay** (autonomous scouting)

### Auto-scavenge
- Players send the rig on **timed missions** (1–12 hours).
- Choose risk level, zone, and fuel load.
- Outcome returns a report: loot + damage + story snippets.

## Economy & social
- **Player trading**: auction board for rare parts.
- **Crew hiring**: NPCs with buffs; can be wounded or leave.
- **Factions**: control territories; players pledge for bonuses.
- **Clans**: group bonuses and convoy events.

## Monetization (optional)
- **Cosmetics**: rig paint, emblems, crew avatars.
- **Convenience**: extra build slots, queue slots, cosmetic-only bundles.

## Next steps (design milestones)
1. **MVP Loop**: scavenge → craft → upgrade → repeat.
2. **Rig Prototype**: basic rig + 2 modules + timed mission.
3. **Social Layer**: clan chat + trading.
4. **Endgame**: territory control + seasonal events.

## Notes on IP
- Avoids direct references to any existing franchises.
- Uses original terminology (war band rook, convoy captain, rig modules).
